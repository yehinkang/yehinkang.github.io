          <p>Democratech Ouija was designed for the <a href="https://hacked-2023.devpost.com/">HackEd 2023</a>
          Hackathon. It consists of what is essentially a 2D plotter with a permanent magnet underneath a laser etched plywood surface.
          this results in the planchette moving seemingly on it's own. We got it to work pretty quickly and decided that it would be more fun as a
          party game of sorts and added a web app at a now long dead site democra.tech, and used it to get audience members to vote on what the next letter 
          should be. Special acknowledgement to my teammates Celine Fong, Toufic Saadeh, Alex Neufeld, and Joshua Brown.</p>

          <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <p>We thought it would be funny if it looked like there was a ghost. 
            After we got it working we thought the more ghosts we could get the board to be influenced by the better.
          </p>

          <h3>My part</h3>
          <p> 
            For this project my part was primarily to do with the hardware. Ensuring that motor geometries were correct and that mounting was secure.
            I also worked to get wiring, and the power supply sorted for the electronics on board.
