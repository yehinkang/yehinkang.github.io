                        Summary:
                    </strong>
                    My family owned the store in Alix, Alberta from 2012 to June 2020, I've been helping out there since I was 12 and had a increasing role in the operations of the business until I left for University.
                    I kept clocking in when I returned home for breaks and resumed working when school moved online due to Covid-19. This experience taught me how to effectively manage time between work and schoolwork,
                    and helped me to develop basic knowledge in HVAC and electronics, from watching and helping to fix coolings systems for the various coolers in the store.
