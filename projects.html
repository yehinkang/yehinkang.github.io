                    3 of my firends and I decided to enter into the Yeehaw Hacks 48 hour hackathon hosted by Major League Hacking.
                    During the hackathon we built a functioning game with 4 levels from the ground up, with aevery aspect of the game made from scratch.
                    This game was made using Unity which required us to get familiar with C#, which we did not have experience with.
                    We were able to adapt quickly and efficiently organize the developement of a game under time constraints and ended up winning the Hackathon,
                    amongst a flurry of submisions from around the world. This is an ongoing project as we continue working on it weekly hoping to release
                    a fuller more fleshed out game in 2021.

                    I love tinkering with things and as such have many skills among
                    which are welding (Stick, MIG, Flux-Core), soldering, brazing,
                    coding & web design (Python, C#, HTML, CSS), and
                    knowledge of repairs in: plumbing, HVAC, electrical, automotive & small engine.
                    Overall I've done everything from repairing faulty circuits to rebuilding CV shafts(pictured).
                    I am good at trouble shooting equipment and fixing/diagnosing issues before
                    they damage other components in the system or impacts the safe operation of the equipment.
