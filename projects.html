                    3 of my friends and I decided to enter into the Yeehaw Hacks 48 hour hackathon hosted by Major League Hacking.
                    During the hackathon we built a functioning game with 4 levels from the ground up, with every aspect of the game made from scratch.
                    This game was made using Unity which required us to get familiar with C#, which we did not have experience with.
                    We were able to adapt quickly and efficiently organized the developement of a game under time constraints and ended up winning the Hackathon,
                    amongst a flurry of submisions from around the world. This is an ongoing project as we continue working on it weekly hoping to release
                    a fuller more fleshed out game in 2021.

                    I needed a guitar amp for a Squier Stratocaster that I was able to piece together from a few years back.
                    I decided that instead of getting a cheaper mass market amp, that I would set out to build my own tube amp that would emulate the classic sound of single ended amplifiers of the 50's and 60's.
                    This design incoroporates many elements from the classic Fender Champ amps of the era as well as the Multivox Premier 50. The desing uses a 12AX7 tube for a pre-amp and uses a 7591A power tube.
                    The power tube choice is rather weird but I'm going to stick with it as I was able to find them locally on Kijiji, along with the 12AX7's.
                    I started this project during the winter break of 2020 and am still waiting on componenets to come in through the mail. (Turns out resistors from China are cheap and plentiful)

                    This project was completed in my Grade 11 year of high school and it remains my first and only foray into developing an electric vehicle.
                    It utilised an electric motor off of an old Schwinn electric bicycle that was laying in a field.
                    I cut up an old bike frame from when I was younger and welded together a custom frame for the back to wheels and seat.
                    The whole bicycle
                    It was powered by 3 motorcycle battereis mounted in series to provide it with 36V as opposed to the 24v that it was initially provided with.
                    This was to provide it with more power and torque due to it now being a primary source of propulsion instead of a pedalling aid.
                    Overall this was a fun project that I'm happy to have created.

                <img class="project_pic" src="images/Projects/TimeClock1.jpg" alt="If you see this something went wrong">
                <p class="content-section box">
                    When my family still owned the store in Alix I took it upon myself to rebuild a compressor clock that controlled the defrost period of a cooler.
                    These were necessary due to alot of the compressors at the store being dated to the 80's or even the 60's!
                    These were mechanical timers that were driven by an electronic motor and had pins that would flip a switch to engage and disengage a defrost period.
                    As these were old clocks the geartrain for the clocks wore down and they were unable to keep time or were broken.
                    Usually this would mean having to buy new ones, but I was able to use gears from different model time clocks to ensure that they will continue to work for a good while again.
                    It was a great foray into the world of electromechanics and one of the first control systems that I worked on.
