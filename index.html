        <p>
            I am currently in my second year of a BSc in Engineering Physics, Nanoengineering option, at the University of Alberta.
            I'm currently located in Lacombe, Alberta, where I graduated from high school. My interests include cars, analog electronics, as
            well as learning how mechanics and electronics work together and interact with our world.
            In my free time I also like to go fishing in the summers and enjoy hitting the skopes to ski in the winter.

                <h3><strong> Why Engineering Physics?</strong></h3>
                I've always been interested in being able to bring ideas to life and I believe that engineering physics provides a broad knowledge base to do this.
                The program combines electrical engineering with advanced physics, and some mechanical engineering, whats more the nanoengineering option also provides insight into nanoscale design.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe that these factors makes this program choice a no brainer. Engineering Physics combines the knowledge of electrical systems that an electrical engineer would possess with knowledge of
                classical, and modern physics that would be required to create systems that bridge the gap between new discoveries in the field of physics with applications in day to day life.

                If you can name it I have pretty much dabbled with it or have looked into it.
                Anything from amateur carpentry to coding, I have tried my hand at and have some experience in.
                I really do aim to be a jack of all trades, as I believe that this will allow me to fully flesh out an idea.
                In the past I've done welding (Stick, MIG, Flux-Core), soldering, brazing,
                coding & web design (Python, C#, HTML, CSS),
                repairs in: plumbing, HVAC, electrical, automotive & small engines.
                I am good at trouble shooting equipment and fixing/diagnosing issues before
                they damage other components in the system or impact the safe operation of the equipment.
                I plan on expanding these skills and hope to be a better maker of things in the future.
