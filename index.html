        <p><strong>I</strong> am currently in my second year of a BSc in Engineering Physics, Nanoengineering option, at the University of Alberta.
        I'm currently located in Lacombe, Alberta, where I graduated from high school. My interests include cars, analog electronics, as
        well as learning how mechanics and electronics work together and interact with our world.
        </p>

            <strong> What is Engineering Physics?</strong>
            I often get asked this question. My best answer is to say that engineering physics is in the ilk of electrical engineering, 
            coupled with advanced physics, and some mechanical engineering.
            Engineering Physics combines the knowledge of electrical systems that an electrical engineer would possess with knowledge of
            classical, and modern physics that would be required to create systems that bridge the gap between
            new discoveries in the field of physics with applications in day to day life.
