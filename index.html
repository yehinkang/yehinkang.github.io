        <p>
            I am currently in my fourth year of a BSc in Engineering Physics, Nanoengineering option, at the University of Alberta.
            I grew up in Alix, AB, and went to high school in Lacombe, AB. My interests include cars, analog electronics, and
            I'm always got a project or two going on.
            In my free time I also like to go fishing in the summers and enjoy hitting the slopes to ski in the winter.

                <h3><strong> Why Engineering Physics?</strong></h3>
                I've always been interested in being able to bring ideas to life and I believe that engineering physics provides a broad knowledge base to do this.
                The program combines electrical engineering with advanced physics, whats more the nanoengineering option also provides insight into nanoscale design.
            </p>

            <p>
                I believe that these factors makes this program choice a no brainer. Engineering Physics combines the knowledge of electrical systems that an electrical engineer would possess with knowledge of
                classical, and modern physics that would be required to create systems that bridge the gap between new discoveries in the field of physics with applications in day to day life.

                If you can name it I've pretty much dabbled with it or have looked into it.
                I've done everything from amateur carpentry to coding.
                I really do aim to be a jack of all trades, as I believe that this will allow me to more easily flesh out an idea.
                In the past I've done welding (Stick, MIG, Flux-Core), soldering, brazing, 3D printing, 2D manufacturing(laser and waterjet),
                coding & web design (Python, C#, HTML, CSS),
                repairs in: plumbing, HVAC, electrical, automotive & small engines.
                I am good at trouble shooting equipment and fixing/diagnosing issues before
                they damage other components in the system or impact the safe operation of the equipment.
                I plan on expanding these skills and hope to be a better maker of things in the future.
